# Hi, welcome to my programming study schedule,
 
> This is  a way for me to be able to organize myself better in my studies.

## I want to become a backend developer, for that I want to have an understanding in the following areas:

* Database
* User Terminal
* C and C++ 
* Linux
* among many other things

### The road map used for better organization is available <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap">here</a>
